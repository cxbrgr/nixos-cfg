🧩 COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
Understanding the moving parts of your machine.

1. Nix Flakes (flake.nix)
The modern standard for NixOS.

    - Role: It "pins" every software version. It ensures that if you install this system on another PC today, it looks exactly like this PC.
    - Behavior: It ignores any file not added to Git. Always git add new files!

2. The System (nixos/)

    - Role: The "Landlord."
    - Responsibilities: Bootloader (Systemd-boot), Kernel, Hardware Drivers (Nvidia/AMD), Networking, Bluetooth, Audio (Pipewire), and System Services (Docker, Virtualization).
    - Access: Requires sudo to apply.

3. Home Manager (home/)

    - Role: The "Tenant."
    - Responsibilities: Installs user apps (VSCode, Chrome), configures the Shell (Zsh, OhMyPosh), and manages "Dotfiles" (linking config files to ~/.config).
    - Access: Runs in user-space.

4. Hyprland - UI

    - Role: The "Window Manager."
    - Responsibilities: Draws windows, handles animations, manages monitors, and processes keyboard shortcuts.
