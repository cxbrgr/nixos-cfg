## 🧩 Component Architecture

### 1. Nix Flakes (`flake.nix`)
**Role:** Declarative System Definition & Version Pinning
- Defines the system architecture and inputs (dependencies).
- Locks all dependencies to specific commit hashes via `flake.lock` to ensure reproducible builds.
- Serves as the single entry point for all configurations.

### 2. System Configuration (`hosts/`)
**Role:** System-Level Management (Root Context)
- Manages the operating system core: Bootloader, Kernel, Hardware Drivers, and Networking.
- Handles system-wide services (Docker, Systemd, etc.) and security policies.
- **Access Level:** Requires `sudo` (root privileges) to apply changes.

### 3. Home Manager (`home.nix` & modules)
**Role:** User Environment Management (User Context)
- Manages user-specific applications (Browsers, IDEs, Tools).
- Configures dotfiles, shell environments (Zsh), and theming.
- **Access Level:** User-space only (typically matches the `~/.config` scope).
